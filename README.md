A training project for C#
"In the rest of this chapter 
we'll explore the predefined elements of the C# language as 
we implement a small program called WordCount. 
WordCount opens a user-specified text file 
and calculates the number of occurrences of each word within the file. 
The results are sorted in dictionary order and written to an output file."
